# log4j_catcher

Log4j exploit catcher, detect Log4Shell exploits and try to get payloads.
This is a basic python server that listen on a port and logs information when a wild log4j exploit appears

The [Phorcys](https://github.com/PiRanhaLysis/Phorcys) dependency is used to decode payload automatically and then match with Yara rules.

## Installation

### Dependencies

```shell
sudo apt install libcurl4-nss-dev libpython3.9-dev libnss3 libnss3-dev
```

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

For ports that don't require TLS

with python:
```shell
python3 detector.py [port]
```

with docker:
```shell
docker build -t log4j_catcher .
docker run -itp 8080:8080 --env PORT=8080 log4j_catcher
```

For services with TLS it is recommended to have another component to handle the TLS protocol.
I typically run NGINX as a reverse proxy on the port 443 to forward https traffic to the honeypot.

Example:
```shell
$ sudo python3 detector.py 80
